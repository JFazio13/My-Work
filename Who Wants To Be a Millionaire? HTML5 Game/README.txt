This is a personal project of mine, to recreate the clock format of the US game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? I found a work-in-progress project on an internet forum and have been continuing its development for months now. Not all of the code is mine, however a lot of it is.

The game must be run using a web server or localhost. Google Chrome or Opera web browsers recommended.

Controls:

'c' key – begin game
'w' key – walk away


Left arrow – money tree controls
Right arrow — reveal question, start clock, advance question, etc.
Up arrow – scale tree for categories
Down arrow – revert scaled tree to dollar amounts

'1' key – lock in answer A
'2' key – lock in answer B
'3' key – lock in answer C
'4' key – lock in answer D

'a' key – activate and progress Ask the Audience lifeline
'd' key – activate and progress Double Dip lifeline
'p' key – activate and progress Phone a Friend lifeline
's' key – activate and progress Switch the Question lifeline
